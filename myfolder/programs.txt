Sort by Shift 1


Sort by Shift 1 

 

One day, Mahirl is interested in finding how to sort a sequence of integers a1,?a2,?...?an in non-decreasing order. Being a young kid, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:

a1,?a2,?...,?an???an,?a1,?a2,?...,?an?-?1.

 

Help Mahirl to calculate: What is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?

 

Input and Output Format:

 

The first line contains an integer, n (2?=?n?=?105).

The second line contains n integer numbers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1?=?ai?=?105).

 

If it's impossible to sort the sequence output -1. Otherwise output the minimum number of operations Mahirl needs to sort it.

Rita and Children 

 

There are n children in Rita's school. Rita is going to give some candies to them. Let's number all the children from 1 to n. The i-th child wants to get at least ai candies.

 

Rita asks children to line up. Initially, the i-th child stands at the i-th place of the line. Then Rita starts distribution of the candies. She follows the algorithm:

 

Give m candies to the first child in the line. 
If this child still haven't got enough candies, then the child goes to the end of the line, else the child goes home. 
Repeat the first two steps while the line is not empty. 
 

Consider all the children in the order they go home. Rita wants to know, which child will be the last in this order?

 

Input and Output Format 

 

The first line contains two integers n,?m (1?=?n?=?100; 1?=?m?=?100). The second line contains n integers a1,?a2,?...,?an (1?=?ai?=?100).

Output a single integer, representing the number of the last child.

{Hint :

Let's consider the first sample.

First child 1 gets 2 candies and goes home. Then child 2 gets 2 candies and goes to the end of the line. Currently the line looks like [3, 4, 5, 2] (indices of the children in order of the line). Then child 3 gets 2 candies and goes home, and then child 4 gets 2 candies and goes to the end of the line. Currently the line looks like [5, 2, 4]. Then child 5 gets 2 candies and goes home. Then child 2 gets two candies and goes home, and finally child 4 gets 2 candies and goes home.

 

Child 4 is the last one who goes home.}
